ls# Project Overview

- This project is a full‑stack CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) web application designed to track job applications in a simple and practical way. Users can add, view, update, and delete job entries, making it a realistic example of how data‑driven applications are built and maintained.
- The goal of this project is to demonstrate a solid understanding of core full‑stack development concepts.

## Tech Stack

- Frontend: React
  - This project uses React to build a component-based user interface for managing job applications. React handles rendering, user input, and application state, making it easy to display data from the backend and update the UI as that data changes.
- Backend: Node.js + Express
  - This project uses Express to create a simple RESTful API for managing job application data. Express handles incoming HTTP requests and routes them to the appropriate logic, acting as the connection between the React frontend and the database.
- Database: SQLite (or in‑memory storage for simplicity)
  - This project uses SQLite to store job application data in a simple, lightweight relational database. SQLite allows the application to persist data without requiring a separate database server, keeping the project focused on core full-stack concepts.
- Version Control & Hosting: GitHub

## What This Project Demonstrates

- Building a RESTful API using Express
- Implementing all four CRUD operations:
  1.  Create new records
  2.  Read existing data
  3.  Update records
  4.  Delete records

- Connecting a React frontend to a backend API
- Managing application state and user input
- Structuring a small but complete full‑stack application
- Writing clear, maintainable code with a defined scope

## Why These Concepts Matter

- CRUD operations form the foundation of most real‑world software systems — from social media platforms to banking applications. Understanding how data flows between a frontend, backend, and database is essential for any software engineering role.
- This project focuses on fundamentals that scale, making it a strong example of practical problem‑solving and real‑world application development.
