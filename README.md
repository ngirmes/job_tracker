#H1 Project Overview

*This project is a full‑stack CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) web application designed to track job applications in a simple and practical way. Users can add, view, update, and delete job entries, making it a realistic example of how data‑driven applications are built and maintained.
*The goal of this project is to demonstrate a solid understanding of core full‑stack development concepts, rather than complex features or flashy design.

#H2 Tech Stack

    *Frontend: React
    *Backend: Node.js + Express
    *Database: SQLite (or in‑memory storage for simplicity)
    *Version Control & Hosting: GitHub

#H2 What This Project Demonstrates

    *Building a RESTful API using Express

    *Implementing all four CRUD operations:

        1. Create new records

        2. Read existing data

        3. Update records

        4. Delete records

    *Connecting a React frontend to a backend API

    *Managing application state and user input

    *Structuring a small but complete full‑stack application

    *Writing clear, maintainable code with a defined scope

#H2 Why These Concepts Matter

*CRUD operations form the foundation of most real‑world software systems — from social media platforms to banking applications. Understanding how data flows between a frontend, backend, and database is essential for any software engineering role.
*This project focuses on fundamentals that scale, making it a strong example of practical problem‑solving and real‑world application development.
