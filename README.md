📌 Project Overview

This project is a full‑stack CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) web application designed to track job applications in a simple and practical way. Users can add, view, update, and delete job entries, making it a realistic example of how data‑driven applications are built and maintained.

The goal of this project is to demonstrate a solid understanding of core full‑stack development concepts, rather than complex features or flashy design.
🛠 Tech Stack

    Frontend: React

    Backend: Node.js + Express

    Database: SQLite (or in‑memory storage for simplicity)

    Version Control & Hosting: GitHub

🧠 What This Project Demonstrates

    Building a RESTful API using Express

    Implementing all four CRUD operations:

        Create new records

        Read existing data

        Update records

        Delete records

    Connecting a React frontend to a backend API

    Managing application state and user input

    Structuring a small but complete full‑stack application

    Writing clear, maintainable code with a defined scope

💡 Why These Concepts Matter

CRUD operations form the foundation of most real‑world software systems — from social media platforms to banking applications. Understanding how data flows between a frontend, backend, and database is essential for any software engineering role.

This project focuses on fundamentals that scale, making it a strong example of practical problem‑solving and real‑world application development.
